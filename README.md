Pathfinding Visualizer
Description
Pathfinding Visualizer is a web application built with React that visualizes various pathfinding algorithms on a grid. Users can create obstacles, set start and end points, and see how different algorithms find the shortest path. This project showcases an understanding of pathfinding algorithms, data structures, and interactive front-end development.

Features
Algorithms Implemented:
A* (A-star)
Dijkstra's Algorithm
Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Interactive Features:
Set start and end points
Create and remove obstacles
Visualize the pathfinding process
Switch between different algorithms
How to Use
Set the Start and End Points:

Click on a cell to set the starting point (green).
Click on another cell to set the ending point (red).
Create Obstacles:

Click on cells to toggle obstacles (black).
Visualize Algorithms:

Click on the "Visualize A*", "Visualize Dijkstra", or "Visualize BFS" buttons to see the algorithm in action.
Revert and Clear:

Click "Revert" to undo the last change or to remove the visualization.
Click "Clear" to reset the grid.
